## day-1

## Architecture

1. monolathic architecture
2. 2 tier
3. n tier (we are use this architecture)
4. moduler monolithic (also we are use this architecture)
5. microservice
6. event Driven
7. cloud native
8. serverless

## day-2

## application perfermance

1. responsiveness
2. stablity
3. scalability
4. resource utilization
5. user expreience

### for a backend app

    ## measure of how fast or responsive a system in under
    1. a given workload
      # backend data
      # request vaolume
    2. a given hardware
      # kind
      # capacity

    3. load testing
    4. benchmarking
    5. log system check

    ## note: every performance problem is then result of some queue building somewhere

    ## where does a queue can build-up? (this is most important for perfarance optimization)
      1. newtork
        # increased latency
        # packet loss
        # full send/receive buffers
      2. database
        # slow query execution
        # database connection pool exhaustion
        # disk i/o bottleneck
      3. application code
        # inefficient algoithom
        # redundant calculations
        # code deadlocks
      4. operating system
        # high cpu utilization
        # excessive memory usage,
        # Long process wait times

    when face the problem? you must sure to know queue.

### what are then root causes?

    1. inefficient slow processing,
      # badly written code
      # external dependencies
    2. serial resources access
      # database access
      # shared files
      # serial executin in code

    3. limited resource capacity
      # memory
      # network bandwidth

# note: we should always try to avoid building queues when designing a new system or find where the is queue building in an existing system

#### performance principles

1.  efficiency

    # reduce response time on a single request

    ## efficient resource utilization(system resources utilization)

        a. io - memory, network, disk
        b. cpu

2.  concurrency

    # reduce response time on a concurrent request

    1. hardware(must have concurrency support - multiple core)
    2. software(we need to code our software that can utilize multiple core)
       a. queuing(this queue is not going to block requests)

3.  capacity

    # increase hardware improve performance

    1. cpu
    2. memory
