# 🚀 Developer English Framework (Practical & Simple)

This framework focuses on **real developer life**: reading, writing, speaking, and daily habits.

---

## 1️⃣ Understand English (Input Skills)

> Goal: Understand code, errors, and technical discussions without panic.

### What to Practice

- **Error messages**
- **Documentation**
- **Tutorials / Blog posts**
- **GitHub issues & comments**
- **StackOverflow answers**

### How to Practice (Daily)

- Read **2–5 error messages** and explain them in simple English
- Read **1 small doc section** (API, README)
- Watch **1 short dev video** (5–10 min)

### Example

- Error:

  > `TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined`

- Meaning:
  👉 I am trying to use `.map()` on a value that does not exist.

---

## 2️⃣ Write English (Output Skills)

> Goal: Communicate clearly in code and team discussions.

---

### A) Git (Commits & PRs)

#### ✅ Commit Message Format

```
type: short clear message
```

#### Common Types

- `feat:` → new feature
- `fix:` → bug fix
- `refactor:` → code improvement
- `chore:` → config / tooling
- `docs:` → documentation

#### Examples (Corrected & Clean)

```txt
fix: header alignment issue
feat: add search volume filter
refactor: clean up login flow
docs: update setup instructions
```

---

### B) Pull Requests (PRs)

#### Simple PR Description

```

## 3️⃣ Speaking English (Daily Dev Life)

> Goal: Speak confidently in meetings & interviews.

---

### A) Daily Standups

#### Simple Structure (Perfect for Beginners)

```
Yesterday: what I worked on
Today: what I will work on
Blockers: any issues?
```
