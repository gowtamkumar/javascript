Boss 👍 no tension.
Here is a **clear, beginner-friendly DSA basic list** (perfect for **non-CSE background** like you).

---

## 🧠 DSA BASICS – WHAT YOU MUST LEARN (STEP-BY-STEP)

### 1️⃣ Programming Basics (Foundation)

Before DSA, make sure you are okay with:

- Variables
- if / else
- loops (for, while)
- functions
- arrays & objects (JS)

👉 Since you are a **JavaScript dev**, you can use **JS for DSA** 💪

---

## 2️⃣ Time & Space Complexity (Very Important)

Learn this early, not deeply at first:

- Big-O Notation
  - O(1)
  - O(n)
  - O(n²)
  - O(log n)

- Time vs Space
- Why optimized code matters

📌 Interview people LOVE this topic.

---

## 3️⃣ Arrays (MOST IMPORTANT)

Start here always.

Learn:

- Traversing array
- Insert / delete
- Reverse array
- Max / Min
- Prefix sum
- Two pointers

Examples:

- Find largest element
- Reverse array
- Move zeroes
- Sum of array
- Remove duplicates

---

## 4️⃣ Strings

Very common in interviews.

Learn:

- String traversal
- Reverse string
- Palindrome
- Frequency count
- Substring

Examples:

- Check palindrome
- Count vowels
- Anagram
- Longest word

---

## 5️⃣ Recursion (Think carefully 🧠)

Understand concept, not fear it.

Learn:

- Base condition
- Recursive call
- Stack overflow

Examples:

- Factorial
- Fibonacci
- Reverse string
- Print numbers

---

## 6️⃣ Searching Algorithms

Simple but powerful.

Learn:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search (VERY IMPORTANT)

Examples:

- Find element in array
- First & last occurrence

---

## 7️⃣ Sorting Algorithms

Don’t memorize code, understand logic.

Learn:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- (Later) Merge Sort, Quick Sort

Know:

- Which is fast?
- Which uses more memory?

---

## 8️⃣ Stack (LIFO)

Real-life usage 👇

- Undo / Redo
- Browser history

Learn:

- push, pop, peek
- Stack using array

Examples:

- Reverse string
- Valid parentheses

---

## 9️⃣ Queue (FIFO)

Real-life usage 👇

- Task scheduling
- Background jobs (like Redis queue)

Learn:

- enqueue, dequeue
- Queue using array

---

## 🔟 Linked List (Medium but important)

Learn:

- Singly Linked List
- Insert / delete
- Traverse

Examples:

- Reverse linked list
- Find middle node

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Hashing (Maps / Objects)

🔥 SUPER IMPORTANT for interviews

Learn:

- HashMap / JS Object / Map
- Frequency counting

Examples:

- Two Sum
- Duplicate elements
- First non-repeating character

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Two Pointer & Sliding Window

These are **techniques**, not structures.

Examples:

- Pair sum
- Longest substring
- Max sum subarray

---

## ❌ What You Can SKIP (For Now)

Since you are **not CSE background**:

- Graph
- Advanced DP
- Trie
- Segment Tree

👉 Learn these **only if targeting FAANG**

---

## 🎯 BEST ORDER TO STUDY (IMPORTANT)

```
1. Array
2. String
3. Big-O
4. Searching
5. Sorting
6. Recursion
7. Stack
8. Queue
9. Hashing
10. Linked List
11. Two Pointer
```

---

## ⏱️ Daily Plan (2 Hours)

- 30 min → concept
- 60 min → solve 3–5 problems
- 30 min → revise + explain yourself (very important)

---

## 💬 Final Advice (Boss Talk)

You **DO NOT need to be DSA master**.
You need:

- Clear thinking
- Clean code
- Problem-solving mindset

If you want 👉
✅ **JS-based DSA examples**
✅ **Interview-focused problems**
✅ **30-day DSA plan**

Just say: **“Boss start array with JS”** 😄
